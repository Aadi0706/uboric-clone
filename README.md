First day we went through the flow of the website and we checked the functionality of the original website and coming to know we can make dynamic website as well as responsive. Later we communicated and divided our work accordingly to build a project.

We all are connected through zoom meet in the morning, evening hours and slack as well. We collected all the information about Uboric and which functionalities we have to add to our project. We break the projects into various parts and allotted them to each other. We started working on all features of the project separately and pushes the code to a different branch of our git-hub repo as a template and merge all the codes accordingly.

OUR CHALLENGES :
